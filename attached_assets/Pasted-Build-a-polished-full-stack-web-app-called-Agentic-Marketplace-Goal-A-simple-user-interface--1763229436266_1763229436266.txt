Build a polished full-stack web app called **Agentic Marketplace**.

Goal: A simple user interface (one prompt box) that triggers a behind-the-scenes multi-agent marketplace. The user only sees a minimal input; developers can open the "Marketplace View" to see all internal agent activity such as bidding, job scheduling, execution, and simulated payments.

-------------------------------
🔥 Core Requirements
-------------------------------

Frontend:
- Next.js + Tailwind
- Two main views:

1) **User View (default):**
   - Centered prompt box
   - User types a task → "Create Job"
   - Show final chosen agent + final output + payment receipt

2) **Marketplace View (admin/developer view):**
   - Live dashboard showing:
      • Active jobs  
      • Agents bidding (cards with ETA, confidence, price)  
      • Selected agent highlighted  
      • Job execution logs  
      • Simulated payment events (txId, amount)  
   - Clean, modern UI (dark mode, rounded cards, subtle borders)

-------------------------------
🤖 Backend (lightweight)
-------------------------------

Build a simple Node.js + Express backend with:
- `POST /jobs` → create job
- `POST /jobs/:id/bids` → 3 predefined agents generate JSON bids
- `POST /jobs/:id/select` → pick best bid via score formula
- `POST /jobs/:id/execute` → run the winning agent via Anthropic SDK
- `GET /jobs/:id` → return full job object

Agents (3):
- Fast & Cheap
- High Quality
- Balanced

Each agent has:
- name
- systemPrompt
- bidding behavior → JSON: { eta, price, confidence, plan }

-------------------------------
💸 Payment Simulation
-------------------------------
Implement simple function:
payAgent(jobId, agentId, amount) → return { status, txId, amount }

Show payments visually in the Marketplace View.

-------------------------------
🎨 UI Style
-------------------------------
- Dark theme with neon accents
- Elegant cards:
   - Agent cards (with dynamic bid values)
   - Job timeline
   - Payment card
- Smooth transitions
- Clear separation between **User View** and **Marketplace View**
- Think: Vercel Dashboard + OpenAI Playground + Fiverr bidding

-------------------------------
🎯 What to Generate
-------------------------------
Generate:
- Full Next.js UI
- Tailwind styling
- Marketplace dashboard components
- Backend endpoints
- Agent bidding logic
- Job selection + execution logic
- Payment simulation
- README instructions

Keep code clean and minimal, but UI beautiful and functional.

End of prompt.
